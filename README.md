## Brief Introduction to the Project

The purpose of this website is to broadcast my skills, information and work history to potential employers and recruiters.
They have a need for IT and viewing this website they can gather clear and defined amount of information.

## UX User Stories
- As a Recruiter/Employer I want to understand the main concept of the site and learn more about the developer.

- As a First time user I want to be able to navigate the site in an easy and efficient way without any complex design.

- As a Recruiter I want to be able to use an array of socials as a way of understanding how trusted and known the individual is.
  I also want to know that I can use another form of communication with them if there are any job updates that match there skills.

- As a First time user I want to be able to read information about the individual in a clear and concise way, with appropriate font and paragraphs
  formatted in a consistent way on the page.

- As a Recruiter/Employer I would want to be able to see the developers CV and have a way of downloading it to my computer so I can keep on file.

- As a Recruiter/Employer I want to be able to contact the developer if I am interested in the individuals work and skill set.


## Design
1. Colour Scheme
- The two main colours used on the site are blue and white. Using a dark and white color together contrasted nicely with the flow of the page.
2. Typography
- The 'Epilogue' font is the main font used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font is not supported by the browser.

## Languages Used

  - This was the main language used and provided the website with semantic elements, giving each section a meaningful name,
  such as nav, section and footer to easily define.
- CSS3

## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
1. Bootstrap 4.5
- Bootstrap is a CSS framework and used throughly throughout the website. The main target of using BootStrap within my site was to make it easier
making the site responsive on mobile devices.
2. Hover.css:
- Hover.css was used added in the head tag. This was for implementing cool looking hover effects when hovering over links.
This feature was not used but was a nice addition for future edits.
3. Google Fonts:
- Google fonts were used to import the 'Epilogue' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.
4. Font Awesome:
- Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.
5. jQuery:
- jQuery is a feature of bootstrap to make the navbar responsive in Javascript.
6. Git
- Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal and initialising commands.
7. GitHub:
- GitHub is used to store the projects code after being commited from Gitpod.
8. Gitpod
- Gitpod is a Program that contained the project workspace and was used to develop and view the html/css inside it.
9. Balsamiq:
- Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.
The Technologies that were used were new and updated versions of HTML and CSS.


## Testing
- The W3C Markup Validator was a feature used to validate all html elements on each page.

- Whereas the W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every snippet of css in the style sheet.

- These were both used to prevent mistakes and would run snytax errors if there was something wrong.

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
  - First Time Visitor Goals

     i. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand main concept of the site and learn more about the developer.
  
    - Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable bootstrap navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a an Image of the developers face with Text "About Me".
   
    - The main points are made immediately with the image and the 'About me' header which is nicely centered and bold.
     The user now knows the site is about the developer, and gets a nice warm feeling like there smiling back at them to encourage them to read more information on the page.

    ii. As a First time user I want to be able to navigate the site in an easy and efficient way without any complex design.
    
    - The overall design has been made to be fluid with a navigation bar with clear defined links to each page.
    
    - On the Contact Page when the form has been submitted the page will refresh and take the user back to the top of the page.

- Recruiter/Employer Goals

  i. As a Recruiter/Employer I want to be able to use an array of socials as a way of understanding how trusted and known the individual is.
  I also want to know that I can use another form of communication with them if there are any job updates that match there skills.
  
  - The Social Icons are located in the footer and are consistent through the site. The user has a range of socials to interact
     with including the 5 main socials, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest.
  
  - A hover effect triggers to indicate that they are about to click it. Clicking on any 5 of the icons will launch there Url.
  
  - This will open in a new browser so that the user can navigate back to the website easily.

  ii. As a Recruiter/Employer I would want to be able to see the developers CV and have a way of downloading it to my computer so I can keep on file.
  
  - The user has 2 options providing a link to the developers cv, giving them more flexibility to make their choice.
  
  - An icon from the top right navbar and an icon on the footer. These icons provide links that when clicked, then the developers CV would
     appear in the browser.
  
  - This CV is made in pdf format and ready for the user to download to their computer.

  iii. As a Recruiter/Employer I want to be able to contact the developer if I am interested in the individuals work and skill set.
  
  - To enter the conact page the user would need to click the 'Contact' link in the navbar
  
  - When entered, they will use the form on the contact page and enter place their name, email and current message into the 3 input boxes.
  
  - When Submit button is pressed, the validation will check for empty fields and the correct input type and alert user if valid.
  
  - Alternatively, to get in contact, the recruiter or employer could use the personal info content in the home page to gather the developers phone number.


## Further Testing
- The website was tested on multiple browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Opera and FireFox, but the main one that was used was Chrome. This was because I was using the chrome extension at the time for gitpod
and I felt chrome was fast and reliable.

- ### FireFox
 
   ![FireFox](/assets/cross-browser/firefox.png)

- The website was viewed on iPhone SE, Android and laptop. There was also use of the developer tools as a faster way to look at the site becoming responsive such as using the example devices in the tools area.
Friends and Family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

- ### Responsiveness
 
   ![Responsinator](/assets/cross-browser/responsinator.png)
- The Responsinator tool was a feature used to view the deployed site and look to see how each device would display it. Device screens such as Android, iPhone and iPads were used to view on. In doing so
they were viewed in a landscape and portrait perspective.

### Bugs
- There was an issue with the footer element in all browsers. The footer would not stick to the bottom of the screen and therefore leave white space between itself and the bottom of the screen. To fix this problem the footer
was fixed to the bottom using bootstrap tools and css styling.
